Before saving or creating scenes/prefabs, verify the target asset path (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/...`) to avoid accidental duplicates, and never write new scene assets outside the project’s intended scenes folder.
When writing editor/setup scripts, avoid `GameObject.Find` for scene UI; locate objects by traversing the known hierarchy and include inactive objects (e.g., via `Transform` traversal from a root or `Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll`) to prevent missing disabled panels.
